use this command in case the frame transforms are not set because the map is missing
$ ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher "0" "0" "0" "0" "0" "0" "base_link" "map"
$ ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher "0" "0" "0" "0" "0" "0" "base_link" "cloud"

use rqt to set lidar parameters
remember to change the frame into the right one where the messages are being sent
set "pointCloudFrameId" to "base_link"
